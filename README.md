# Procedural-Terrain-Generator
Procedural terrain generator made in Unity. The terrain is managed with chunks and is created with a 3D Perlin noise algorithm, which allows the program to generate also a cave system. Each block of the terrain is destructible. 

At the moment, threads are not implemented, so the execution freezes for a moment every time it generates a new chunk of terrain.
